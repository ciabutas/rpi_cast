# Contributing

Pull requests are always appreciated, regardless of shape and size, from everyone. 

* To get started, fork and then clone the repo:

    `git clone git@github.com:your-username/RaspberryCast.git`

* Run the setup script:

    `./setup.sh`

* Make your changes. There are no formal test requirements, but we encourage testing as much as possible.
A few static unit tests will be completed using Travis-CI.

* Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].

[pr]: https://github.com/vincelwet/RaspberryCast/compare/

At this point you've done all you can, good job! As soon as we can, we'll have a look at the code and hopefully accept it as soon as possible. If your PR is very large and/or exhaustive, we might have some questions or comments, and we might suggest some improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Clearly and concisely explain what your PR hopes to achieve.
* Write [good commit messages][commit].
